XWMM - XBMC Web Media Manager
====

### DEVELOPMENT REPO:
Will contain both Zernables and Slashes work which should come as patches from all corners and merged in other
Tagged repositories Like Frodo for e.g.

Information should be posted here and some rudimentary wiki formation about XWMM etc if its needed.

### SUBMITTING PATCHES AND PR's
The best idea is to fork this and make a PR to this repo (Master Repo) it should contain some of the follwoing:

* What Patch addresses, if its a bug-fix a feature or something else.
* Any commnets to code for what is not immediatly obvious.
* It will be reviewd and merged as soon as possible by someone who understands whats going on.

Thank you for Submitting Patches or PR's to XWMM
